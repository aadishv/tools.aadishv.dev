# tools

I've built a variety of tools. They are all built using React, tailwindcss, and shadcn/ui. Some are used by just me, some are clones of a common app, and some have unique functionality and are used by dozens of people.

All of my tools are open-source! I don't talk about some of my tools here because

1. Some are incomplete. I often use my website to test random React projects because 1) it's way easier than spinning up a new repo each time, 2) easy to deploy thanks to Astro's GitHub actions integrations, and 3) shadcn components with my preferred styles are already preinstalled.
2. Many of these are things that I only built for a niche use case; to be real, I don't use many of these tools often. Some are for a specific class and some are for an one-off thing where I thought, "wow, there wasn't a non-bloated tool for doing this, let's do it myself." Similarly, I often do experiments with vibe coding here, trying out prompts to build random things. TL;DR - I would not want others to use some of these tools.
3. While all tools are open source (see ↓), explaining the purpose of some of these would require explaining some detailed IP which I'm not able to expand on in depth right now.

All of my code, even for IP-sensitive projects, is freely licensed and available at [this folder](https://github.com/aadishv/tools.aadishv.dev).

_Note: tool descriptions were generated by GPT-4.1 when provided with detailed documentation and source code._

## [chinese practice](/chinese)

**Aadish's Chinese Practice** is an interactive tool I built to help myself (and others) practice Chinese characters and pinyin. It features two main modes: character writing (with stroke order checking and hints) and pinyin typing (with tone mark support and hints). The app tracks your progress using a traffic light system (green/yellow/red) and stores your history locally, so you can see which characters you’ve mastered and which need more review. You can select which lessons to practice, view your history, and reset your data at any time.

All sentences are from the Integrated Chinese textbook, scraped and processed with a little help from Gemini 2.5 Pro. The UI is intentionally minimal and distraction-free, with a focus on fast iteration and feedback. The code is open-source and lives [here](https://github.com/aadishv/tools.aadishv.dev/tree/main/src/tools/chinese). For a full rundown, see [this help article](https://aadishv.dev/blog/using-chinese).

## [periodic table](/periodic)

**Periodic Table** is my modern, interactive periodic table for chemistry students (and anyone who likes pretty elements). It started as a SwiftUI app and grew into a full-featured web tool. Features include:

- All 118 elements, color-coded by type (inspired by Google Arts Experiments)
- Click any element to see detailed info: electron configuration (abbreviated and full), group, atomic mass, electronegativity, oxidation states, and a fun fact
- Formula mass calculator: type any chemical formula (supports parentheses and nested groups) and get the molar mass instantly
- Fuzzy search (name, symbol, or atomic number)
- Reference tab with helpful chemistry images (Aufbau, bonding, solubility, etc.)
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility features

The data is scraped and merged from several sources, and the UI is built for speed and clarity. The code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/aadishv/tools.aadishv.dev/tree/main/src/tools/periodic). See the [project page](https://aadishv.dev/project-periodic-table) for more details and a live demo.

## smaller tools

This section is a grab-bag of smaller utilities, one-off experiments, and class-specific helpers. Some are polished, some are just for me, and some are here because I couldn't find a non-bloated alternative online.

### [om013 practice](/om013)

A simple flashcard app for studying for my precalculus (OM013) finals. It shuffles a deck of trig, vectors, complex numbers, and conics facts, and lets you self-test with "I knew it!" or "Review again" buttons. Supports KaTeX for math rendering and even restores links in explanations. Not fancy, but it got me through finals.

### [LaTeX to image](/latex)

A minimal tool to convert LaTeX equations into images (SVG, PNG, or GIF) using the [CodeCogs API](https://latex.codecogs.com/). Features live preview (with KaTeX), copyable image URLs, Markdown snippets, and even clipboard image copying (with html2canvas). Built because I was tired of bloated LaTeX renderers and wanted something fast for blog posts and docs.

### [KaTeX Playground](/katex-playground)

A live KaTeX playground for experimenting with math typesetting and Markdown-style math in real time. Type any text or math (using `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, or `\[...\]` delimiters) and see instant KaTeX-rendered output, with error messages for invalid LaTeX. Input is cached locally, and the UI uses shadcn/ui components for a clean, modern look. Great for learning KaTeX, prototyping math snippets, or debugging equations.

### [diff tool](/diff)

A live diff tool for comparing two versions of text. Click "Freeze Text" to snapshot your current text, then edit away and see the differences highlighted (additions in green, deletions in red). Supports both character-level and line-level diffs, and is intentionally as simple as possible—no bloat, no ads, just diff.

### [Slide Puzzle](/slide)

A classic 4x4 slide puzzle game where you can use a default image or upload your own. It tracks moves and time, and saves your custom image in your browser for next time. A fun, simple game built with React.

### [Fantasy AI Rankings](/fantasy-ai)

A drag-and-drop ranking tool for fantasy AI teams. You can reorder a predefined list of teams, name your list, and then generate a shareable URL that saves your custom ranking. The interface uses smooth animations for a polished user experience.

### [Isometric Grid Paper](/isometric)

An interactive digital canvas for creating isometric art. Pick a color and fill in triangles on the grid to build 2.5D shapes and scenes. You can save multiple designs to your browser's local storage and use the color picker to easily reuse colors from your drawing.
